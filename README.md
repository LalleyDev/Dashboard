# Dashboard
## Description
This is a self hosted dashboard application. 

This project will develop much more as I finish boot.dev's Typescript servers lessons.
## Why?
There are so many of these out there why create another? Well I am trying to better my skills in html, css, http servers and typescript. This seemed like the most practical option for creating a decoupled application that would be useful in my day to day. 

## Current State
This application currently has the front end typescript mostly completed

Upcoming:
1. Write the backend http handling.
2. Write the backend data handling.
3. Make the front end GUI nice.

## Quick Start
```
git clone https://github.com/LalleyDev/Dashboard
```
```
cd Dashboard
```
```
npm install
```
To start website:
```
npm run dev
```

Once finished the plan is to make this into a docker image so it can be easily deployed in tandum with the other self hosted projects on my server.

## Contributing
Any recomendations are more then welcome as I am trying to learn.
