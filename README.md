Todo for next time:

What we learned today. 

The DOM/Javascript can not write a file to the server. This is for security reasons. 

What we know for next time. 

yeah we could just write a .json file and have that parse the links but that is not the point of this project. 

So to fix this we are going to look into express. It looks like it will allow me to create a "backend" server that I can have listen for a certain url and will allow me to pass information back and forth. 

I dont know if this is the best way to do it. Hopefully I will find that out next time.
